PROJECT SUMMARY 

The primary goal of the Steve Irwin chatbot is to provide engaging, accurate, and family-friendly information about animals. It is designed for use both in zoo kiosks and on personal devices at home, allowing users of all ages to learn more about wildlife in an interactive way. In addition to animal education, the chatbot also teaches users about Steve Irwin himself, celebrating his legacy as a passionate wildlife conservationist and educator. 

Steve Irwin was chosen because of his worldwide influence on wildlife education and his unique, enthusiastic communication style. His recognisable personality, humour, and passion for animals create an engaging learning experience that appeals to both children and adults. Using Steve Irwin as the inspiration adds creative value, making the chatbot feel lively, authentic, and emotionally engaging while honouring his commitment to conservation and wildlife awareness. 

The chatbot delivers factual, reliable information about animals, supporting informal learning in zoos and at home. It aims to inspire curiosity about nature and wildlife conservation, just as Steve Irwin did. The creative value comes from the conversational style: responses imitate Steve’s enthusiasm, friendliness, and signature excitement, making learning more fun and memorable for families. 

The chatbot provides: 

Text-based responses to questions about animals. 

Accurate animal facts suitable for both kids and adults. 

Consistent Steve Irwin-inspired personality in all interactions. 

Safe, family-friendly dialogue (no swearing, no inappropriate content). 

Its initial design focuses on conversation and information retrieval, with potential for future expansion such as voice interaction or animal photo recognition. The system follows a user-centred and education-focused design philosophy, prioritising clarity, accuracy, and ease of use. Authenticity to Steve Irwin’s mannerisms and tone is a core design element, ensuring that the chatbot feels warm, energetic, and trustworthy. Accessibility is supported through simple language, optional child-friendly explanations, and consistent behaviour across devices. 

Beyond class-taught content, the project integrates: 

AI-driven natural language processing (API-based conversational model). 

Deployment across multiple platforms, including zoo kiosks and personal devices. 

Group collaboration on both technical and design components. 

These technical additions extend the chatbot’s capabilities beyond standard classroom tools, demonstrating advanced use of AI technologies. 

 

Requirements 

Explain how you gathered and defined your system’s requirements. 

Did you brainstorm as a team? Look at similar chatbot systems? Conduct informal user testing? 

Summarise how the requirements evolved over time (for example, early ideas → final specification). 

Present your requirements in tables for clarity. 

Requirements gathering process: 

Our requirements were gathered mainly through a combination of team brainstorming, accessibility rules, comparing current AI Chatbots UI/UX and through asking AI to help conceptualise suggestions. Initially, we identified the mandatory elements of the brief, such as using a React frontend and an Express backend. We combined these with ideas linked to Steve Irwin’s personality and character. This resulted in a draft focused on authenticity, accessibility and animal-based content. 

 

After forming this initial draft, we expanded the requirements using several methods. Accessibility remained a topic of priority throughout the process, for example guidelines around readable font sizes. These considerations shaped requirements aimed at making the app usable for everyone no matter digital literacy or physical capability. We also analysed existing chatbots to understand common issues and UI/UX patterns 

 

Evolution of requirements: 

During development, we used MoSCoW method to classify each of the requirements. Features such as JSON dialogue and accessibility became “Musts”, whilst more ambitious ideas such as chat history or voice input were classified as “Coulds” personas and user stories helped shape further requirements and allowed us to tweak existing requirements to better fit our use cases.

IMPLEMENTATION 

Explain how you built the system, including tools, frameworks, and coding practices. 

Outline your main components (frontend, backend, JSON engine). 

Describe how the chatbot logic works — include a short JSON example. 

Explain any testing or validation you performed. 

Mention how you ensured code quality (e.g., JSDoc comments, consistent structure, Git branching). 

Include screenshots of key system features if space allows. 

 

The chatbot frontend was built on a modern JavaScript stack, using React (via Vite) for the component-based, responsive user interface. All styling was managed with CSS to ensure accessibility and fluid design.  The backend uses Node.js with Express to handle HTTP requests and serve the application. The server manages communication between the frontend and the JSON-based scripting engine. Express oversees error handling to maintain system stability. Collaborative development was managed using Git and GitHub. GitHub projects was used to track individual workflow and allowed for seamless delegation of tasks. Each capability was developed separately before merging into the main code. This reduced integration conflicts and allowed for collaborative parallel development. 

 

Core Components 

The React frontend manages user input through a controlled form and renders conversation history on screen. State management uses React hooks to track messages and handle API requests. React provided responsive styling that adapts to different screen sizes. CSS allowed us to effectively follow our design as its extremely modular and customisable. The Express server exposes RESTful endpoints for message processing. When a user submits input, the server validates it, passes it to the JSON scripting engine and returns the response. If a response is out of our scope, it sends it to a LLM to handle specific questions in the same Steve Irwin persona. Session management tracks conversations through in-memory storage. 

 

Code Quality Practices 

All functions include JSDoc comments with parameter descriptions. File organisation separates React (frontend) components and Express (backend) routes into dedicated directories. 

 

 

Testing and Validation 

Manual testing was performed extensively during development to validate chatbot responses and to test UI interactions. The keyword matching algorithm initially faced issues due to it noticing common words inside of other words, for example “hi” in “which animal was the fastest” returning a greeting. This was found due to testing with various input patterns and after a few iterations worked effectively with accurate topic detection. Whole-word matching was implemented and validated to fix issues where partial word matching caused incorrect responses. The GROQ LLM layer was tested to ensure generated responses maintained the Steve Irwin persona, including Australian slang usage and enthusiasm for wildlife. Firefox, Chrome and Safari tested to ensure design is consistent against different browsers. Additionally, testing on multiple devices was implemented to ensure mobile responsiveness 

 

Version Control 

Git and GitHub were used for version control throughout the project lifecycle. Commits follow descriptive naming conventions to document changes clearly and to allow all collaborators to understand updates. Github projects tracked tasks and issues to coordinate team collaboration. The .gitignore file excluded node modules and env files from version control to ensure no secret API keys were leaked. Vercel configuration enabled seamless deployment of both the frontend and our backend.
