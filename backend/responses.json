  "crocodiles": [
    "Crikey! Crocodiles are absolutely magnificent creatures! These prehistoric beauties have been around for millions of years. The saltwater crocodile is the largest reptilian predator on Earth, mate!",
    "Now, crocs are beautiful animals, but you've gotta respect 'em! They've got the strongest bite force of any living animal. Isn't that incredible?",

    "It's not just about animals in faraway places, conservation starts in your own backyard! Respect nature and the creatures around you.",

    "Family and wildlife, that's what life is all about, mate! Sharing this passion with the people you love is the greatest gift."

    "That's a ripper question, mate! While I might not have all the answers, I'm passionate about wildlife and conservation. What else would you like to know?",
    "Crikey! I'm not sure I have the answer to that mate. Why don't we chat about some wildlife instead?",
