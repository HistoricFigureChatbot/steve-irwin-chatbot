Can I use Generative AI tools?
Basic spelling and grammar correction tools are permitted.
Full Generative AI
You may use generative AI throughout the assessment to support your own work. You do not need to
acknowledge which content is generative AI-generated.
Tasks:
You will work in a team to design and develop a web-based chatbot system that simulates conversations with
a historical figure of your choice. This could be a well-known figure such as Cleopatra, King Tutankhamun, Ada
Lovelace — or someone more niche and interesting like Graham Gore, Mary Anning, or Takashi Nagai.
Your chatbot must:
• Run as a React front-end app with an Express backend, written in either JavaScript or Typescript
• Use a JSON-based scripting engine to control conversation logic
• Present an accessible, responsive user interface
• Include documentation and reflection on your team process, design decisions, and use of any AI tools
Your project should demonstrate strong software engineering practice, including requirements gathering, user-
focused design, architecture decisions, testing, and version control.
Submission Coursework Brief
Team Working & Expectations
You’ll work in a team of four students to design and build your chatbot system. You can choose your own group
by completing the team signup form on Brightspace by 15th October 2025. If you don’t submit a group, you’ll be
assigned one.
All students must:
• Contribute to the project — this is a software engineering assignment, and everyone is expected to have
evidence of hands-on applied work.
• Work professionally: attend meetings, stick to your plan, and communicate regularly with your group.
• Submit an individual peer review form. This helps us identify if anyone didn’t contribute fairly — marks
may be adjusted based on this.
• Raise serious issues early. Use the peer review form or contact the unit leader directly.
Groups of a different size may be allowed in exceptional circumstances, but only with approval from the unit
leader. These groups will still be marked according to the same criteria as four-person teams.
Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
1. Understand the software development process and lifecycle as well as activities in different stages with
appreciation of software quality and relevant professional standards, legal and ethical principles.
2. Demonstrate the ability to critically analyse the requirements, design and develop software applications.
3. Understand and improve security and usability during the development.
4. Demonstrate the ability to work in a team in applying the above to solve complex problems.
Submission Format:
You must submit the following via Brightspace:
• A .zip file containing your full project code (React frontend and Express backend).
• A short video demo (maximum 6 minutes, .mp4 format).
• A group project report (maximum 12 pages, excluding references and appendices (max 5 pages), PDF
format).
• An individual peer evaluation form (PDF format).
A report template will be provided and must be followed. Reports that do not follow the structure or exceed
the page limit may be penalised. All group members are expected to contribute equally.
The group project report should provide a clear account of your system and process, including:
• Project summary.
• Well-structured requirements (including accessibility).
• System design and architecture overview.
• Explanation of your JSON or AI-based chatbot logic.
• Notes on team workflow and tools used.
• Reflection on key challenges and lessons learned.
• References should be in the APA standard
The video demo should present your work in a clear and professional way. It must:
• Demonstrate the working system and key user interactions.
• Show how the chatbot responds to input and manages dialogue flow.
• Briefly explain the design process and major technical decisions.
How will this be assessed?

Questions about this assessment:
Your questions regarding the brief will be addressed by the teaching team (Dr Benjamin Gorman,
bgorman@bournemouth.ac.uk, Dr. Yan Gong, ygong@bournemouth.ac.uk) during lectures, labs, via email, on
MS Teams.
Academic Integrity
The work you submit must be your own. Any attempt to gain an unfair advantage in your assessment by
cheating, deception or fraud is considered an academic offence. The 'Assessment help and support' section of
the unit (found under 'Assessment' in the content area) provides more guidance on avoiding academic
offences, including any guidance on what will or will not be considered an academic offence in this
specific assessment.
Help and support
The 'Assessment help and support' section of the unit (found under 'Assessment' in the content area) provides
information and guidance, including specific information on support for this assessment. It provides help with
our policies on deadline extensions and information on support available in the university, including academic
skills support and additional learning support for students with disabilities.
Disclaimer: The information provided in this assignment brief is correct at time of publication. In the unlikely
event that any changes are deemed necessary, they will be communicated clearly via e-mail and via the VLE
and a new version of this coursework brief will be circulated.
